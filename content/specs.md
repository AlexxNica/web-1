The Open Container Image format specification is a work in progress. It is being developed collaboratively on Github at [http://github.com/opencontainers/specs](http://github.com/opencontainers/specs).
The newly expanded team of maintainers (both original libcontainer maintainers and the appc maintainers) are busy preparing the first draft of the specification, and intend to release it in 2-3 weeks.

The specification includes a reference implementation that is developed at [http://github.com/opencontainers/runc](http://github.com/opencontainers/runc).
