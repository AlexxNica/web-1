The Open Container Project is open governance structure for the express purpose of creating an open industry standard for container runtime.

It has been announced June 20th 2015: [Press Release](http://fixme.com), [Blog Post](http://fixme.com).

In the past two years, there has been rapid growth in both interest in and usage of container-based solutions. Almost all major IT vendors and cloud providers have announced container-based solutions, and there has been a proliferation of start-ups founded in this area as well. While the proliferation of ideas in this space is welcome, the promise of containers as a source of application portability requires the establishment of certain standards around format and runtime. While the rapid growth of the Docker project has served to make the Docker image format a de facto standard for many purposes, there is widespread interest in open industry standard container specifications, which are:

1. not bound to higher level constructs such as a particular client or orchestration stack, and
2. not tightly associated with any particular commercial vendor or project, and
3. portable across a wide variety of operating systems, hardware, CPU architectures, public
clouds, etc.

The specification will be available at [https://github.com/opencontainers/specs](https://github.com/opencontainers/specs). The newly expanded team of maintainers (both original libcontainer maintainers and the appc maintainers) are busy preparing the first draft of the specification, and intend to release it in 2-3 weeks.

Runc, the reference implementation of the OCP specification will be available at [https://github.com/opencontainers/runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/rrunc)

The following organizations are sponsors of the Open Container Project:

* Docker
* Microsoft
* full list
